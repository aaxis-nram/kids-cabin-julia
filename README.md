# Assigning Kids to Cabins on Overnight FieldÂ Trips
A computation algorithm for multi roommate matching with full Julia code

Assigning kids to cabin, police officers to patrols, flight crew on flights, sportspersons to teams, interns to hospitals, etc requires preference-based matching between members. This article presents an algorithm and a computational implementation in Julia, to achieve maximum happiness in the group. Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching is adapted by adding voting by members to generate preference lists.

## Running the Program
